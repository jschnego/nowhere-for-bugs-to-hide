TDD LIVE EXAMPLE
---

The aim of this sandbox example is to implement a function that will take in a list of usernames and output a social network-style text tag that displays to users who has liked a post.
The format of the output will depend on the number of users, e.g.:

[]                                -->  "No one likes this"
["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
["Jacob", "Alexandra"]                 -->  "Jacob and Alexandra like this"
---
["Jane", "John", "Lisa"]           -->  "Jane, John and Lisa like this"
["John", "Grace", "Bob", "Sandra"]  -->  "John, Grace and 2 others like this"

Every commit represents one iteration, so you can step through them by checking out each commit in turn.
